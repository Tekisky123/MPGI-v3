The new economic policy—globalization, privatization, and liberalization—has widened the horizon of business. The information technology revolution has transformed this planet into a global village. Hi-tech systems and the supersonic speed of communication have introduced new cross-cultural interactions in the global business scenario. This has also increased the demand for a strong ethical value foundation in a harmonic form. It is the responsibility of the School of Management to develop holistic leadership with a global vision and a mission of excellence. The School of Management at Matoshri Pratishthan’s Group of Institutes is fully committed to this task.
